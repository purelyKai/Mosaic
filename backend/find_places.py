# alternatively we could create a CRON job that fetches and populates places every few X hours 
# and goes across common tourist destinations across the world. Then we wouldn't need to fetch the places
# and insert them into the vector db every single time a user opens the app.
# Or we can do a mix of both
# It limits our availability to common tourist destinations but we would be able to expand in the future and
# it makes it quicker to load.

# also one more thought for the vector embeddings, we could make it so we also have a CRON job updating a user embedding.
# or every ~5 likes they do we update their embedding.
# because i have a hunch that the actual modification of the user embedding will take a good amount of time. rengenerating an embedding every 
# like will be annoying if they are saving often.
